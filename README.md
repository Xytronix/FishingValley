### Active mods

* **Fishing Valley ( in Alpha )** <small>([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8668) | [source](Fishing%20Valley))</small>  
  _This mod adds new "fish" and a new area: The Albatross Fishing Resort, that can be reached by bus once you repaired it. Over 50 new fish have been added just in the Alpha. New fish can only be fished at the resort, with the exception of crab pot fish, those can be obtained anywhere. All species in the mod are real living species._
