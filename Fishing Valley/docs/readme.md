# Fishing Valley

## Description

This mod adds new "fish" and a new area: The Albatross Fishing Resort, that can be reached by bus once you repaired it. Over 50 new fish have been added just in the Alpha. New fish can only be fished at the resort, with the exception of crab pot fish, those can be obtained anywhere. All species in the mod are real living species. Here are the fish stats, locations and gift tastes. Beyond this you experience the mysteries why you got into the world of Stardew Valley. You as an adventurer will find out about the secret that book of your grandpa hold.

## FAQ

### Is X mod compatible ?

Just try it. We have not the time to test it with every single mod you have in mind. If you find any incompatibility let us know, so we can have a look.

### I have lots of missing fish entries on my fish collection tab, why?

Some fish are in the game, but are not fishable yet, you can fish over 50 for now. Currently some maps are worked on, before we can add all fishes.

### Can you add X thing/mechanism to the game?

Yes, we are working to exceed our knowledge and are open for ideas. Create a thread [here](https://github.com/Xytronix/StardewMods/discussions) and let us know!
