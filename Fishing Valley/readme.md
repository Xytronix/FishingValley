# Fishing Valley ( Under development )

## Description

This mod adds new "fish" and a new area: The Albatross Fishing Resort, that can be reached by bus once you repaired it. Over 50 new fish have been added just in the Alpha. New fish can only be fished at the resort, with the exception of crab pot fish, those can be obtained anywhere. All species in the mod are real living species.

## FAQ

### Is X mod compatible ?
Should be as no changes have been made to vanilla.

### I have lots of missing fish entries on my fish collection tab, why?
Some fish are in the game, but are not fishable yet, you can fish over 50 for now.

### Can you add X thing/mecanism to the game?
I'm a 1 man team, with very limited coding knownledge, so odds are no.
